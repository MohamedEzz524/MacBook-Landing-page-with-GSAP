react-spring/three: to allow animations

Light: has properties like Color Intensity Position
<pointLight /> : emits light in all direction from single point
<spotLight /> : emits light in all direction from single point(but in shape of cone)

<hemisphereLight> : illuminates the scene with a gradient
primitive: that means we can simply consume the 3d model that we'r going to use (like sky and unlike island that contains multiple meshes and we need it for dragging and scroll)
